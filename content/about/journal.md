## Aims and Scope

*Neuroanatomy and Behaviour* (ISSN: [2652-1768](https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/2652-1768)) is a free open access peer reviewed journal for behavioural neuroscience research. We publish research and review articles investigating neural processes or how these influence behaviour. These can take a broad range of approaches, from studies of neural anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, and animal behaviour to human psychology, computational studies, and theoretical neuroscience. We hope that the scientific advances published in the journal will advance our understanding of normal and dysfunctional neural and psychological processes with the potential to contribute to advances in healthcare for mental disorders and neurological diseases. As a free open acccess journal, authors retain copyright, articles are licensed for reuse, and there are no fees for authors or readers.

*Neuroanatomy and Behaviour* supports evidence-based medicine. We do not publish studies using complementary and alternative medicines, such as homeopathy, acupuncture, or naturopathy.

*Neuroanatomy and Behaviour* recognises the importance of both animal models and human trials in advancing our understanding of neuroscience and mental health. We welcome studies using animal subjects and human participants subject to their compliance with accepted ethical procedures and principles.

Digital preservation is an essential function of publishers. In the short-term, we use off-site digital server backups combined with a publicly available archive of the journal on [Github](https://github.com/epistemehealth/neuroanatomy-and-behaviour) and this [static mirror](https://nab.epistemehealth.com). We achieve long-term digital preservation by encouraging all authors to archive their final published PDFs in their institutional and disciplinary repositories, engaging with [Australian legal deposit](https://www.nla.gov.au/legal-deposit) requirements, and through digital archiving agencies. We currently participate in the [PKP Preservation Network](https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/), which is a member of the [Keepers Registry](https://keepers.issn.org/keepers), and plan to join a [TRAC-certified digital preservation archive](https://www.crl.edu/archiving-preservation/digital-archives). Issues archived with the National Library of Australia and State Library Victoria can be accessed through [Trove](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-2057639965). Digital preservation information for each article can be viewed in Crossmark metadata.
